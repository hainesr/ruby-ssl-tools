# Ruby SSL Tools

*Robert Haines*

## Synopsis

These ruby scripts are simple examples of how to achieve various things using
SSL and HTTPS. Their purpose is purely for my own education so they may well be
rather buggy and not fit for purpose. Error and input checking is done randomly
and in many cases not at all.

## Usage

See the help for each individual script with the `-h` option.

## Requirements

### Version 1

Tested with ruby 1.8.7.

The HighLine gem is required. If you're on unix then the termios gem is
recommended as well.

### Version 2

Tested with ruby 2.5.1 and 2.6.3.

No gems required.
